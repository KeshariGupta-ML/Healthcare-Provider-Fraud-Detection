## Introduction
Fraud is **wrongful or criminal deception intended to result in financial or personal gain**. Nowadays, fraud is very common in any area like tax fraud,
credit card fraud e.t.c.. It is also very common in the Healthcare area. Health
care fraud is a type of fraud involving the use of the health care system by
an individual, medical provider, or insurance company in a deceitful manner
in order to profit from it. Nowadays, Insurance institutions face many false
claims and duplicate claims. And the time to approve and verify the claims is
very less, around 15-30 days.So it is not possible to check each and every
claim manually. In many cases, Healthcare providers fill the details in
insurance form and file the claims at the place of other beneficiaries which is
very hard to figure out that is legitimate or fraudulent without checking
ground truth. So here we will analyse and detect “Healthcare Provider
Fraud” based on given data.


Healthcare fraud and abuse take many forms. Some of the most common
types of frauds by providers are:


a) Billing for services that were not provided.
b) Duplicate submission of a claim for the same service.
c) Misrepresenting the service provided.
d) Charging for a more complex or expensive service than was actually
provided.
e) Billing for a covered service when the service actually provided was
not covered.

## Business Problem

Many providers make false claims at the place of other beneficiaries so
Insurance institutions are more vulnerable in healthcare fraud due to this
reason, insurance companies increased their insurance premium and as a
result healthcare is becoming costly data by day.


Here, our task is to minimize the false claims by providers and to do so, we
will have to provide a solution which will predict the potential fraudulent
providers based on previous claims filed by them. Along with it, we will focus
on discovering the important variables which help to detect the behaviour of
potential fraudulent provers. And using this solution, we will be able to make
the right decision for the false claims which will save the money from false
claims and prevent the Insurance company from financial loss
